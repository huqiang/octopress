Steve Jobs, billionaire co-founder of Apple and the mastermind behind an empire of products that revolutionised computing, telephony and the music industry, has died in California at the age of 56.

On October 5, 2011, Apple released a statement saying that Jobs had died. The statement read “We are deeply saddened to announce that Steve Jobs passed away today. Steve’s brilliance, passion and energy were the source of countless innovations that enrich and improve all of our lives. The world is immeasurably better because of Steve. His greatest love was for his wife, Laurene, and his family. Our hearts go out to them and to all who were touched by his extraordinary gifts”. His family, in a separate statement, said Mr. Jobs “died peacefully today surrounded by his family …”

A brief statement from Steve Job’s family was released, “Steve died peacefully today surrounded by his family.”

Also on October 5, 2011, [apple.com][1] greeted visitors with a simple message: Steve Jobs’ black-and-white picture, his name and his years of birth and death. Clicking on Jobs’ image led to an obituary that read: “Apple has lost a visionary and creative genius, and the world has lost an amazing human being. Those of us who have been fortunate enough to know and work with Steve have lost a dear friend and an inspiring mentor. Steve leaves behind a company that only he could have built, and his spirit will forever be the foundation of Apple.” An email address was also posted for the public to share their memories, condolences, and thoughts.

Bill Gates released statement saying *“I’m truly saddened to learn of Steve Jobs’ death. Melinda and I extend our sincere condolences to his family and friends, and to everyone Steve has touched through his work. Steve and I first met nearly 30 years ago, and have been colleagues, competitors and friends over the course of more than half our lives. The world rarely sees someone who has had the profound impact Steve has had, the effects of which will be felt for many generations to come. For those of us lucky enough to get to work with him, it’s been an insanely great honor. I will miss Steve immensely.”*

Jobs is survived by his wife, Laurene, to whom he was married for 20 years, their three children, and a fourth child [Lisa Brennan-Jobs][2] from a previous relationship.
