Here are the tips to get extra Dropbox space, up to 19GB, FREE!

**Signup**

If you signup directly, you can get 2GB free space. If you signup via someone’s referral link, you can get 250MB extra space. The referral can get 250MB/500MB, depending on whether his/her account is connected with an education institute Email. You can ask for referral link from your friends who are using Dropbox, or you can use my [referral link][1].

**Get started**

After signing up, the first way t earn 250MB space is to complete the tasks on G[et Started][2]. These tasks are really simple, and they can help you better use Dropbox. If you are an existing user who have not done it, when you go to G[et Started][2] you will find most of the tasks are done and you can get the extra space ![:-)][3] .

**Connect social networks**

Unlike Get Started, there is no link on homepage to this option. What you need to do is going to [dropbox.com/free][4], and connecting your social networks with Dropbox, namely Facebook and Twitter. Dropbox offers 128MB for each action, and you can get 768MB in total by complete all the options.

**Connect to .edu Email**

A normal user can earn 250MB when he/she invites a friend, and it doubles for users with .edu Email.

> Dropbox is making the transition back to school easy by giving everyone with an .edu email address double the credit for referrals. That’s **500 MB per friend** you invite! That goes for everyone you’ve already referred too.

The email account doesn’t have to end with .edu, as long as it is from your school, which is in the database of Dropbox. You don’t need to re-sign up using your .edu Email, but you can just connect that Email to your existing account. Here is the [link][5] to the page.

**Invite friends**

This is the best way to increase your space. you can invite maximal 32 friends, which means **8GB **for normal account and **16GB** for .edu account!

Simply go to [Referrals][6] page and get your Referral link. You can spread this link on Facebook, Twitter, Email, anyway you think is efficient. I don’t think this is spamming since Dropbox is a good tool and it is worth sharing.

You may choose to earn space by teaching your friends in Science Faculty or the frieshies of your school to use Dropbox.

**Another way**

If you bother doing all above, you can just pay a little to get it. On [taobao.com][7], many people are selling this service at around 12CNY, which is around $2.
