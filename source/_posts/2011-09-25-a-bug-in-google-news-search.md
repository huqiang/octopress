In Google News search, the left navigation bar overlays the search result, see the image below:

This was in Safari

After implementing elements in both Safari and Chrome, I found this bug only exists in Safari where the width of the left navigation bar, 175px, is greater than that in Chrome.

Viewed in Safari, the width is 175px

In Chrome, the width is 132px, which is good enough.

I suspect this is just a typo. Hopefully Google can fix it very soon.
