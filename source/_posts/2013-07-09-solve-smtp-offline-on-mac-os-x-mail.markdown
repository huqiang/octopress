Recent days, I have problems sending out email in Mail App, on Mac OS X Mountain Lion. Little invistigation shows that the accounts information for SMTP server are messed, wrong accounts are used for different servers.
The solution is simple and straightforward:  

1.	In Mail, open `Preferences`;  
1.	In `Accounts` tap, select the account whose `Outgoing Mail Server(SMTP)` is labeled as `offline`;  
1.	Click the SMTP server, and select `Edit SMTP Server List` from the list;  
1.	Then you need to fill in the correct username and password.
